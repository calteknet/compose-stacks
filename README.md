This is my initial attempt at documenting the deployment of Ubuntu servers with Portainer.io in a Docker swarm configuration.
I have combined 2 different deployments here. I hope to be able to separate them at some point.
One is the odoo 16 and 17 single deployment that still has some issues with regard to admin_passwd reseting itself and not having a db filter specific to each instance.
Two is the newly added portainer traefik3.1 multi-odoo17 files that are deployed as https://shec.us and https://cmclatimer.com
This is a work in progress and I plan to update it as things change.
cheers!
